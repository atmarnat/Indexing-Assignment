# Indexing-Assignment
### Assignment
Create a basic key/value store: 

1. Create a struct named `KeyValue` which contains one `string` "key" and one `object` "value" as `public readonly` instance fields
1. Implement a constructor for `KeyValue` which sets the instance fields
1. Create a class named `MyDictionary` which contains one array of KeyValue structs and one `int` to keep track of the number of stored values as private instance fields. You may choose a reasonable fixed size for the array. 
1. Implement an indexer which takes a string (key) and returns an object (value).
    1. The `set` property should search the array for the given key and replace the KeyValue with a `new KeyValue(...)` if it exists. If the key does not exist, it should be added as a `new KeyValue(...)`.
    1. The `get` property should search the array for the given key and return the associated value if it exists. If the key does not exist, the property should throw a KeyNotFoundException.
1. Your code should compile against the following `Main` method and print a KeyNotFoundException followed by the line "42, 17" to the command line.

    {
        var d = new MyDictionary();
        try
        {
            Console.WriteLine(d["Cats"]);
        }
        catch(Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex);
        }
        d["Cats"] = 42;
        d["Dogs"] = 17;
        Console.WriteLine($"{(int)d["Cats"]}, {(int)d["Dogs"]}");
    }
}
